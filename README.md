# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML
#### This project uses Linear Regression algorithm to make the prediction with two variables.

Step 1: Import libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. Read the CSV data file and segregate the two variables. Plot a graph using the two variables.

Step 2: Split the data into training and testing data and train the model using Linear Regression. 

Step 3: Make prediction using test data.
